# React Native - _Helsinki University Fullstack Course, Pt. 10_

In this part, we learnt how to build native Android and iOS mobile applications with JavaScript and React using the React Native framework. We dove into the React Native ecosystem by developing an entire mobile application from scratch. Along the way, we learnt concepts such as how to render native user interface components with React Native, how to create beautiful user interfaces, how to communicate with a server, and how to test a React Native application.
